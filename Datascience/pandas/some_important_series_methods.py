'''Example Series

import pandas as pd

s = pd.Series([1, 2, 2, 4, 5, None], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'])

This creates the following Series:

a    1.0
b    2.0
c    2.0
d    4.0
e    5.0
f    NaN
dtype: float64

1. agg()

Use Case: Summarizing a Series

Imagine you're tracking daily sales in units, and you want to quickly get the total sales and average sales for the week.

total_and_avg_sales = s.agg(['sum', 'mean'])

Output:

sum     14.0
mean     2.8
dtype: float64

Practical Example: You can use agg to quickly understand your total sales (sum) and average sales (mean), which are key performance indicators for your business.

2. astype()

Use Case: Converting Data Types for Integration

You have a Series of product prices, but the prices are in float, and you need them as integers for an application that only accepts whole numbers.

s_as_int = s.astype('int32', errors='ignore')

Output:

a    1
b    2
c    2
d    4
e    5
f    NaN
dtype: object

Practical Example: When integrating with systems that require specific data types, astype helps ensure compatibility by converting floats to integers.

3. between()

Use Case: Filtering Data within a Range

You want to find which sales days had units sold between 2 and 4 (inclusive), perhaps to analyze mid-performing days.

mid_range_sales = s[s.between(2, 4)]

Output:

b    2.0
c    2.0
d    4.0
dtype: float64

Practical Example: You can quickly filter the sales data to focus on days that performed within a specific range, allowing you to target specific days for further analysis or marketing efforts.

4. clip()

Use Case: Capping Outliers

You might want to cap the sales data to a maximum of 4 units because any day with sales above that is considered an outlier or a promotional day.

capped_sales = s.clip(upper=4)

Output:

a    1.0
b    2.0
c    2.0
d    4.0
e    4.0
f    NaN
dtype: float64

Practical Example: Capping values with clip helps you normalize data by limiting the influence of extreme values (outliers) when analyzing typical sales performance.

5. drop_duplicates()

Use Case: Ensuring Unique Entries

You have recorded the same sales data twice by mistake and need to clean it up by removing duplicate entries.

unique_sales = s.drop_duplicates()

Output:

a    1.0
b    2.0
d    4.0
e    5.0
f    NaN
dtype: float64

Practical Example: drop_duplicates helps clean up your data by removing repeated entries, ensuring each sales figure is unique, which is crucial for accurate reporting.

6. dropna()

Use Case: Cleaning Missing Data

You've discovered that some sales data is missing (NaN), and you want to remove these entries before running an analysis.

clean_sales = s.dropna()

Output:

a    1.0
b    2.0
c    2.0
d    4.0
e    5.0
dtype: float64

Practical Example: Removing missing data with dropna is essential for ensuring that calculations like totals or averages are accurate and don't include incomplete data.

7. fillna()

Use Case: Filling Missing Data with a Default Value

If the missing sales data needs to be considered as zero sales (maybe because the store was closed), you can fill the missing entries with 0.

filled_sales = s.fillna(0)

Output:

a    1.0
b    2.0
c    2.0
d    4.0
e    5.0
f    0.0
dtype: float64

Practical Example: fillna is useful when you need to make assumptions about missing data, like assuming zero sales on certain days, to maintain consistent and complete data for analysis.

8. filter()

Use Case: Selecting Specific Data Points

Suppose you only want to analyze sales data from specific days, like the first and last days in your data.

selected_sales = s.filter(items=['a', 'f'])

Output:

a    1.0
f    NaN
dtype: float64

Practical Example: filter allows you to focus on specific entries based on criteria like days of the week, making it easier to drill down into specific parts of your data.

9. iloc[]

Use Case: Selecting Data by Position

If you want to review the sales data for the middle three days of the week (2nd to 4th entries), you can use iloc.

middle_sales = s.iloc[1:4]

Output:

b    2.0
c    2.0
d    4.0
dtype: float64

Practical Example: iloc is helpful when you need to access data based on its position in the Series, such as selecting a specific range of days or entries.

10. isnull()

Use Case: Identifying Missing Data

You want to know which days have missing sales data so you can address these gaps.

missing_data = s.isnull()

Output:

a    False
b    False
c    False
d    False
e    False
f     True
dtype: bool

Practical Example: isnull is useful for quickly identifying which entries have missing values, allowing you to investigate and correct or address these gaps.

11. map()

Use Case: Mapping Values to Labels

You want to categorize the sales data into labels like 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High' based on the units sold.

sales_category = s.map({1.0: 'Low', 2.0: 'Medium', 4.0: 'High', 5.0: 'High'})

Output:

a      Low
b   Medium
c   Medium
d     High
e     High
f      NaN
dtype: object

Practical Example: map allows you to convert numerical data into categorical labels, making the data easier to understand and communicate, such as when creating reports or visualizations.

These examples demonstrate how you might use each pandas Series function in practical, real-world scenarios to manage and analyze data effectively.'''
