<!-- display:inline; This will make an element like text to take only the part of which its size is 
    display:outline; This will make an element like button to take all the part i.e the whole line
    display:none; This will remove the element from the place (no blank is created) its place is taken by other element
    
    visibility: hidden; This will hide the element from the place (blank is created)-->

    position:absolute #this will take the position of the screen
    left: right: top: button: #and move the object relative to the screen ends(scrollling creates dikkat in this case if we fix
     it to end,scrollling will change it i.e it is just fixed at the same place)

    it doesn't get scrolled )

    further scroll
