due to the increasing cost of cpanel but

yet in case if you need a c panel you

reliable they have free SSL Premier

malware and hack protection and best of

more about why them so for PL you can

Cel as I told you like very few

companies provide C hosting now days and

yet you know information provided uh

they also provide woocommerce souring so

in case if you want to run an e-commerce

plug-in which is being used on WordPress

for creating an e-commerce website so in

case if you need that they also have

that solution for that uh for they also

dedicated servers in case if you want to

buy domains they also provide domains as

well

and now let's move on on why you know

you need to offer in motion of Hosting

so right now you can see that they have

99.99% uptime and security monitoring

again one of the industry's best over

500,000 WordPress installations and

still counting award winning services

and support teams and you know they have

an industry leading 90 days money back

Guaranty let me be very honest with you

that 90 days money back guarantee nobody

offers it even many cing companies offer

just a 30 days money back guarantee so

90 days is a huge huge huge huge huge so

yeah you can buy with the confidence

because they offers 90 days money back

guarantee and they are committed to open

source community and web development so

and you

know they have a us-based 24x7 support

they provide complete Service Solutions

and they are dedicated uh for security

and again flexible Payment Systems is

you know also they offer it but every

other company also offer that flexible

billing as well

they also have stepbystep education

channels Community Support Forum so you

can see R case studies right now at the

this time they have a support staff of

350 members and they have 100 170,000

customers and the number is growing at a

very fast speed so now let's move on

their plans I'm going to open with you

the WordPress shared hosting plans and

uh reseller plans as well as woocommerce

plans as well as VPS hosting and as well

as dedicated servers so you have guys

and have an idea on what to offer so

shared hosting even you can host your

WordPress website on shared hosting so

shared hosting is a is an hosting you

know which you can uh which you actually

utilize with other people on a same

server uh so the advantage of using

shared hosting is that the P are cheaper

and for the majority people I recommend

to offer shared hosting reseller or VPS

dedicated is for advanced users only so

with shared hosting the offer code

launch power and Pros so four plans they

offer and all of the plans are free SSL

in this plan you can host two websites

in the other you can host unlimited

websites and the bandwidth is limited in

the first plan at 100 GB even 100 GB is

official and they provide unlimited

bandwidth to X speed performance here

you get more speed performance at 6X 12x

20x unlimited emails in all of the plans

except in this plan you get just 10

emails so 24x7 support everything is

included and you know you get a free

domain free website builder and the best

of all C panel is included for those who

don't know that c panel is actually

industry's finest control panel which

have a lot of software on just a one

click installation and very famous very

wellknown uh you know uh the control

panel in the indust C panel and they

have an option of transfer your website

to in hosting so you know in case of

doing transfer just select this plan and

you can do the process all hasslefree

with your team and support guiding you

with this and for the website in case if

you want to build your own website they

have this plan as well on a website

builder plan as

well now let's move on the WordPress

hosting you can see that a c included

WordPress security hack and malare

protection automatic backups and free

envm SSD storage php7 and PHP 8 so in

these plans they also offer four plans

WB core Louch Power Pro with they

recommend at WP Pro so again just like

the same uh same plans let me look on

the pricing as well so 2.99 over here

and it's 3.99 so I recommend you can off

even for shared hosting and you can host

your WordPress website as well in the

Shar hosting plan as well but in case if

you are very specific and you have a

website getting good traffic then op for

WP WordPress plans you can see that in

this plan you also get a pro level

support and dedicated IP even the simple

support is very good

now you can see that WordPress Made Easy

uh free mag tools faster WordPress free

certificate and the best is they include

premium plugins as well so plans like

speed caches total upkeep and more plans

you know free website migration

WordPress updates and role play

production is included free WordPress

teams are also included you can host

multiple

websites so yeah it's a good uh winwin

for anyone who want are looking for

WordPress hosting but even I recommend

to you know that shared hosting is also

good and now let's move on to the

reseller hosting plan you can see that

with the resellers they offer four PL

and make sure you know that the all of

the prices are based on 2 years the

prices will be different on monthly year

or even for all plans like you can see

over here the price is going to be

reduced like this plan was 2.99 and 3

years it became 2.49 so the prices

varies according to the flexible payment

terms and conditions you are for with

the reseller hosting you can see their

plans and now to the woocommerce hosting

over here you can see their plans over

here so for those who want to host

e-commerce website woocommerce hosting

plans are good but again you can get

wmer with the WordPress and Shar hosting

plans as

well and now move on to the VPS plans so

with the VPS offers four plans again

starting from 99 $9.99 goes till

$44.99 all of the plans are equally good

and I do not recommend for any beginner

to use a VP VPS or a dedicator server

but it is only for advanced users and

you have a choice to of control panel

you get free SSL you get dedicated IPS

you get unlimited bandwidth or 2tb and

SSD storage 4GB Ram starting from two

CPU Cordes goes up till 8 CPU Cordes and

the ram goes up to 16 GB and the hard

drive goes up to 360 GB with you know

they emphasize a lot on speed with SSD

storage and the plant have a DD do

protection as well and e-commerce

optimized as well and now let's move on

to the dedicated server page over here

and you can see that uh they offer

manage dedicated server as well with C

panel starting at

[Music]

$89.99 and goes till

$259.99 per month H oh no I mean they

goes up to

$739 uh per month as well and the

biggest plan have 52 GB Ram with two 3.2

TB SSD hard drive I mean huge with 32

core CPU 10 gbps unmet bandwidth

dedicated I 30 dedicated IPS and one TB

free backup and 100 C licenses you know

it is very good

deal and let's look on the basic plan

the basic plan has uh 34 by7 support you

can see that that you have also have a

choice of data center in some plans but

the basic plan has only Los Angeles

California data center available but

with other plans you have an option of

choosing any other data center as per

your preference and

and uh you know all the plans have 24x7

365 Live support and the basic plan has

10 CP C panel licenses so it means that

you can create 10 uh accounts still good

but I recommend like in case if you want

to start a hosting company then offer

the 20 C licenses plan you get a 10gb

free backup storage here you get a 50 GB

free backup and here you get 100gb okay

for those who don't know that having

that St SP uh space doesn't necessarily

mean that you are going to utilize it I

have seen many case studies you know

where people have around 100 GB 200 GB

storage but they don't utilize that much

but rather they utilize a specific

portion of that and they you get an

Intel xon over here with four core uh

and eight thread and 10 TB you know

bandwidth which is again huge for anyone

and with the security suit you can see

that free SSL hack and malware

protection DD do protection automatic

backups available as well so yeah price

for money is over here as well and now

let's on to the bare metal plans over

here for the bare metal the price you

know uh gets further reduced and to goes

to

$69.99 because you in that you are not

using C panel C pricing start with 9.99%

of the bare metal is even cheaper with

that 69.99 and the same plan now costing

at

66999 so in case if you are not control

panel specific then you can opt for Bare

as well but for people who are not uh

you know expert then I do not recommend

to offer uh bare metal so in case if you
